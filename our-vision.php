                    <h4>1. Misunderstanding digital economics:</h4>
                    <p>One of the main ideas we learned in microeconomics was economic rent; benefit acquired more than
                        an organization's capital cost. But businesses have failed to understand this concept; slanted
                        digital strategies build more value to customers than for firms. This is essential but
                        terrifying news for Companies and enterprises expecting to transform digital capabilities into
                        economic success. Instead, they discover digital unbundling valuable service atonement, freeing
                        consumers to purchase only what they want. </p>

                        of your investments. To achieve peak marketing performance, we collect, track, analyze, and

                        information to tweak or streamline esteem chains, are progressively perilous. Platforms that
                        permit advanced players to move effectively across industry and sectors borders are annihilating

                <p>The most widely recognized reaction to digital threats we experience is the accompanying:
                    <br>
                    <strong> "I need to make something new to enter the era of disruption".</strong>

                <p>Understandably, that turns into the driving catalyst for the system. However, for most organizations,
                    the speed of disruption is lopsided, and they can't simply leave existing business models. They need
                    to digitize their current strategies and innovate new models.

                        <br> <br> Our survey and consequent meetings with business pioneers reveal to us that numerous
                        organizations are deprioritizing change or innovation to focus on four things: supporting their
                        core business, conserving money & limiting risks, advancing in available spaces, and pausing
                        until "there is more transparency." But, we believe that especially in times of transition, more
