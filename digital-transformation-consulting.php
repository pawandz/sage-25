                            these businesses, the achievement rate doesn't surpass 26%. Yet, in more conventional
                            enterprises, like oil and gas, auto, foundation, and drugs, digital transformation are
                            considered a severe challenge: achievement rates fall somewhere in the range of 4 and 11

                                and unstructured.
